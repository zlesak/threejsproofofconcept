## Description

This repository contains the MISH APP application, created as part of a master thesis at the University of Hradec Kralove.
It provides a web-based user interface for interaction with anatomical 3D models, and it contains both the user
interface and the backend in a single deployable application.

The UI is built with the Vaadin framework and Three.js for 3D rendering. The backend stores chapters, quizzes and
uploaded model files in MongoDB (with GridFS for the binaries) and authenticates users against Keycloak.

The backend logic was originally a separate service (https://github.com/Foglas/mishprototype) deployed together with
the UI by a separate set of scripts (https://github.com/zlesak/MISH_SCRIPTS). Both have been folded into this
repository; see [docs/backend-migration.md](docs/backend-migration.md) for how and why.

## Running the application

Everything needed to run the application — database, identity provider and gateway — is in the `infra` directory:

```bash
cd infra && cp .env.example .env && docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open <https://localhost> and log in as `alice` / `password` (teacher) or `bart` / `password` (student).
See [infra/README.md](infra/README.md) for configuration, the `mish` hostname used by the tests, and TLS certificates.
For production deployment, secrets and running on a Raspberry Pi, see [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md).

## Testing

### JS and TS app part tests (Vitest)

```bash
npm run test
```

### E2E tests (Playwright)

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Three.js canvas performance tests

```bash
npx playwright test e2e/threejs-canvas-perf.spec.ts
```

Results are written to `test-results/threejs-perf-results.json` after each run.

### Usability walkthrough

```bash
npx playwright test e2e/usability.spec.ts
```

Measures how long each user task takes and how many interactions it costs; the report lands in
`test-results/usability-report.md`. See [docs/user-testing-plan.md](docs/user-testing-plan.md).

### Java unit and component tests (Maven)

```bash
./mvnw test
```
